# bitchat for Android

A secure, decentralized, peer-to-peer messaging app that works over Bluetooth mesh networks. No internet required, no servers, no phone numbers - just pure encrypted communication.

This is the **Android port** of the original [bitchat iOS app](https://github.com/jackjackbits/bitchat), maintaining 100% protocol compatibility for cross-platform communication.

## Install bitchat

You can download the latest version of bitchat for Android from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/permissionlesstech/bitchat-android/releases).

**Instructions:**

1.  **Download the APK:** On your Android device, navigate to the link above and download the latest `.apk` file. Open it.
2.  **Allow Unknown Sources:** On some devices, before you can install the APK, you may need to enable "Install from unknown sources" in your device's settings. This is typically found under **Settings > Security** or **Settings > Apps & notifications > Special app access**.

- `/pass [password]` - Set/change channel password (owner only)
- `/transfer @name` - Transfer channel ownership
- `/save` - Toggle message retention for channel (owner only)

### Getting Started

1. **Install the app** on your Android device (requires Android 8.0+)
2. **Grant permissions** for Bluetooth and location when prompted
3. **Launch bitchat** - it will auto-start mesh networking
4. **Set your nickname** or use the auto-generated one
5. **Connect automatically** to nearby iOS and Android bitchat users
6. **Join a channel** with `/j #general` or start chatting in public
7. **Messages relay** through the mesh network to reach distant peers

### Android UI Features

### Channel Features

- **Password Protection**: Channel owners can set passwords with `/pass`
- **Message Retention**: Owners can enable mandatory message saving with `/save`
- **@ Mentions**: Use `@nickname` to mention users (with autocomplete)
- **Ownership Transfer**: Pass control to trusted users with `/transfer`

## Security & Privacy

### Encryption
- **Private Messages**: X25519 key exchange + AES-256-GCM encryption
- **Channel Messages**: Argon2id password derivation + AES-256-GCM
- **Digital Signatures**: Ed25519 for message authenticity
- **Forward Secrecy**: New key pairs generated each session

### Privacy Features
